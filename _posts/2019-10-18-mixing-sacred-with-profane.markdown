We've already discussed in class how weird books breakdown the most fundamental seperations that we hold. What's inside and outside the book? Who's the author? What's art and what's not. Here I present some music that does the same, they use profane to create art or use art to further or comment on profanity.

### Deoxys Beats - Del ecchi al Hentai
A (debatably) good music produced by mixing in audio from porn in with a harmonious(I'm not a music expert so don't take my word for it) instruments.

Warning: **NSFW**, use headphones (just generally avoid others listening to you listening to it).

### Pixie Paris - Es rappelt im Karton
A perfectly normal (debatable) song if you either don't know german or have no clue of the context. However, once you do get to know of the context it becomes a slightly weird song. For the experience, I'd recomend watching the video first before reading the context. Hover over <img src="" style="cursor: pointer;" title="Its a song for a sex toys delivery company advert in Germany." alt="here.">

The [actual ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMHzrNntGPk) is a bit less subtle.
