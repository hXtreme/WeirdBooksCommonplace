`This is not for you.`

As we get to ending our encounter with the book and put together all our observations from this expedition into the house I get to the following conclusion:

The House of Leaves is alive or at least the apparition behind it is and like any other living being, it tries to stay alive and thrive, furthermore it manages to do it with a certain degree of success. 

Within the book it manages to survive by taking root in the forest in the form of stairs then through Navidson's creation the Navidson record, it propogates itself to Zampano and thrive, leading Zampano to create an extensive write up on Navidson record. Later on it takes the form of a book at the hands of Johnny. After many more hops from person to person it finally reaches me.


Studying each hop we can understand the tactics employed by the entity. Frankly speaking it's very simple but that's what makes it effective, a basic hook line and sinker act. 

It baits it's host with a sense of mystery. Why are there stairs in the middle of nowhere? The dimensions of the house don't match up. What's behind that door? What is the movie trying to say? Is it a romance or horror? What are all those pieces of paper? Why are the some refrences real and others fake?

As we try to answer these questions, initially it caves in and gives us some feasible answers. Its only a difference of few inches, I could've made an error. Zampano's just a troll, messing with people... Fooling everyone into thinking that if they put a bit of effort, they'll answer everything.

Then to properly resolve these question, there's a need to organize thoughts, write down everyting clearly and precisely, documenting thoughts and ideas. 
Essentially attempting to create a document on navigating the house. Exactly what the house wants, creating more of the House outside the confines of the physical book. 

The house has taken host in me and everyone that tries to explain its features. Discussing, and arguing over the meaning of the house we generate more of the house.

The House of Leaves will never end as long as I or anyone else is still writing about it.
