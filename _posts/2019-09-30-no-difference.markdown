The alternate, but equally valid reading of the name 'It makes no Differance' points to the song witht he same name. While initially this reading may look like a strech, we see a lot of thing that are prominent in House of Leaves are mentioned i the song. It's at a level where it can not not be a valid reading.

It makes no difference [where I turn][HOL-turn]  
I can't get over you and the flame still burns  
It makes no difference, [night or day][HOL-night-day]  
The shadow never seems to fade away  

And the sun don't shine anymore  
And the rains fall down on my [door][door-1]  

Now there's [no love][HOL-no-love]  
As true as the love  
That dies untold  
But the clouds never hung so low before  

It makes no difference [how far I go][HOL-far]  
Like a scar, the hurt will always show  
And it makes no difference who I meet  
They're just a face in the crowd on a dead-end street  

And the sun don't shine anymore  
And the rains fall down on my [door][door-2]  

These [old love letters][HOL-zampano-poem]  
Well, I just can't keep  
Just like the gambler says:  
"Read 'em and weep"  
And the dawn don't rescue me no more  

Without your love, I'm nothing at all  
Like an [empty hall][HOL-empty-hall], it's a lonely fall  
Since you've gone it's a losing battle  
Stampeding cattle, they [rattle the walls][HOL-walls]  

And the sun don't shine anymore  
And the rains fall down on my [door][door-3]  

Well, I love you so much  
That it's all I can do  
Just to keep myself from telling you  
That [I never felt so alone before][HOL-alone]
