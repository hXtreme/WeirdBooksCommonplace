We start diving into the labyrinth from page 41 following the theme of echoes. Looking up footnote 46 yeilds a more or less of a dead end and a fictional book. However we find more (or less; depending on how you see it) luck with finding information on ["Adonta ta mele"][Adonta ta mele], a poem (from what I could understand) about loss of self, all of it depicted in a fairly unsettling manner. Furthermore, in ["Adonta ta mele"][Adonta ta mele] we see `echoes` with alterered wording, something that we *experience* in HOL.


>You’ve been stripped of everything
