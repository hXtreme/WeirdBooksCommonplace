We start diving into the labyrinth from page 41 following the theme of echoes. Looking up footnote 46 yeilds a more or less of a dead end and a fictional book. However we find more (or less; depending on how you see it) luck with finding information on ["Adonta ta mele"][Adonta ta mele], a poem (from what I could understand) about loss of self, depicted in a fairly unsettling manner. Furthermore, in ["Adonta ta mele"][Adonta ta mele] we see `echoes` with alterered wording, something that we also *experience* in HOL.


> You’ve been stripped of everything
>
> …Tripped of everything
>
> ….Ripped of everything.

This idea of giving new meaning to an echo is further explained within House of Leaf as following:

> It (The echo) possesses a quality not present in the original, revealing how a nymph can return a different and more meaningful story, in spite of telling the same story.

Another form of echo in HOL is that we experience a recurring story. Story of how the HOL affects Zampano and Johnny, driving them both away from sanity.
